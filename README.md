# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

Using WCAG 2.1 accessabilty guidelines I did a refactor on the website without changing the pages original look. I consolidated unecessary css, using semantic html, fixing the title tag, and adding alt images were done to improve the accessability to the website. Vscode is the primary IDE I use in conjunction with Github to fix the issues quickly.
